# Replant Swamp Trees - Minecraft Mod

Planting oak saplings in swamps generate swamp trees.  The only way swamp trees appear in minecraft is by natural generation in swamps.  This mod allows the player to regrow these trees.  If you take an oak saplings (the same kind that would drop from the swamp tree) and plant it within a swamp, it will spawn a swamp tree.  If you grow the oak sapling outside of a swamp biome, you still get the expected behavior of an oak tree. 

Requires Fabric.  (contact me if you think I can do this without Fabric, I'm new to modding.) 

Works on both client and server.
